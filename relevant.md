Dated terminology and programs referenced, but concepts are still rock solid. |



## General Java

| [OpenJDK source](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk) | Hotspot JDK source code. Very useful for peeking into the internals of the HotSpot VM implementation and core JDK classes. Archival copies also available ([7](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk7u) ... [18](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk18u)) |
| [OpenJ9 source](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9) | OpenJ9 JDK source code. |
| OpenJDK <ul><li>[9](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/)</li><li>[10](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/10/)</li><li>[11](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/)</li><li>[12](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/12/)</li><li>[13](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/13/)</li><li>[14](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/14/)</li><li>[15](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/15/)</li><li>[16](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/16/)</li><li>[17](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)</li><li>[18](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/18/)</li><li>[19](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/19/)</li></ul>| OpenJDK project pages for each JDK release. Each page contains links to the JEPs _(JDK Enhancement Proposals)_ in the version. Following these pages is useful for staying up-to-date with the status of the Java language. You can also find pending proposals on the site that are not tied to any JDK release yet which can sometimes have some interesting goals. |
| [Java Specifications](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/) | Oracle's languange and JVM specifications for each version of Java released. I'd reccomend Chapter 4, the class file section. |
| [/r/Java](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/) | The Java subreddit. Topics focus on relevant libraries/frameworks and version update news. |
| [Migrating from Java 8 to Java 11](https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/from-java-8-to-java-11.html) | Stephen Colebourne's blogpost on upgrading Java 8 code to support the new modular system and account for deprecated libraries. |
| [Jetbrains Blog - Trisha Gree](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/author/trishagee/) | Trisha Gee has an excellent series _"Java Annotated Monthly"_ documenting interesting events in Java each month. |
