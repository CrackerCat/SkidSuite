## Obfuscation Samples

A [list of obfuscation samples](obf/README.md) from different obfuscators. You can evaluate the effectiveness of each sample on your own terms with your own tools of choice. All samples are based on a [provided jar](obf/obf-sample-test.jar).

## Obfuscation Techniques

A [list of various obfuscation techniques](obf-techniques/) is also available. These provide a brief summary of what the technique is and how it works.
